            BiteParty is a React Native Application that I developed along with
            my friends, with the goal of solvng the problem of choosing a place
            to eat when going out with a group of friends. The app lets users
            set basic preferences such as radius, price range, and dietary
            restrictions. Once the user sets those filters, everyone in the
            group will see the same 10-15 restaurants and will swipe right or
            left depending on what they want
