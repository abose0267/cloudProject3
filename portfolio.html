    <p>Some of my projects...</p>

    <p>
      Biteparty: One of the projects I have worked on in the past was called
      BiteParty. The purpose of BiteParty was to help groups of friends find a
      place to eat with ease. The app would take into account the preferences of
      everyone in the group and then recommend places to eat based on everyone's
      preferences. The app would display the restaurants in a tinder style
      swiping UI, and would allow users to read information about a restaurant
      and swipe right if they like it or swipe left if they don't. I developed
      this project with my friends and we used React Native to develop the app.
