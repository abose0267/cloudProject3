            BiteParty is a React Native Application that I developed along with
            my friends, with the goal of solvng the problem of choosing a place
            to eat when going out with a group of friends. The app lets users
            set basic preferences such as radius, price range, and dietary
            restrictions. Once the user sets those filters, everyone in the
            group will see the same 10-15 restaurants and will swipe right or
            left depending on what they want

            BiteParty was built in React Native with a Firebase backend. Behind the scenes, during the course of each party, our app would take in data from each person in the party based on if they swiped right or left, and then calculate a score for each restaurant based on the swipes, and then would reccomend the restaurant with the highest score.

              Zenith is a mobile application that I developed with my friends that was designed to be a good mixture of Google Classroom and Remind. The app would act as a more efficient ways for students in classrooms or clubs to communicate with the club leaders or teachers. This communication would allow for the clubs/ classes to be run more efficiently, and with less mistakes on either side.

            Zenith was a mobile application that was built using Xcode, Swift, and Figma for front end tasks and Firebase for the backend. The app was built with the goal of being a more efficient way for students to communicate with their teachers and club leaders. The app would allow for students to ask questions, and for teachers to answer them. The project was built in a team of 3, took a total of 4 months to complete. The eventual goal of this project was to dip my toes into mobile application development and get a feel for working closely in small teams to deliver a good product at the required dates.
