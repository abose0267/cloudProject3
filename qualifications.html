        <li>
          Added core functionalities to a React Native app that would allow

        <li>
          Refactored entire React Native code base to bring down monthly
          database reads by nearly 80% by implementing a caching method to cache
          data once the app loads, and use that cached data throughout the app
          as opposed to reading from the database on each screen

          Used React Native and Firebase to develop a fully functional cross platform application from start to finish, while overcoming many challenges in the process when it came to implementing core functionalities in the most efficient ways.
